## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Favorite applications:

1. Instagram:
   - Variety of content through friends' posts or reels
   - Changing nicknames of friends in group chats or direct messages
     
2. Spotify:
   - Being able to see what friends are listening to.
   - Making collaborative playlists with friends.
   - Seeing your most listened artists and songs at the end of each year.
     
3. YouTube:
   - Reccomended playlists or videos that match my current taste
   - Accessing your entire watch history and finding old interesting videos.
  
An app idea that I would like to build is a strategy card game that uses versions of chess pieces as the cards.

## Notes

While making this app, I struggled with navigating the immense ammount of tools and options on the screen, and I got slightly confused midway navigating the storyboard.
